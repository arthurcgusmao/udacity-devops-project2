# Project 2 - Udacity Azure DevOps Engineer Nanodegree

## Introduction
In this project, we build a Github repository from scratch and create a scaffolding that will assist you in performing both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. We'll use Github Actions along with a `Makefile`, `requirements.txt` and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. We'll also integrate this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.
